# Deploying a React & GraphQL Full-Stack App on AWS: Choosing the Right Services

## AWS Services Used

- **Front-end Deployment:** We will use AWS Amplify.
- **GraphQL Back-end:** AppSync will be employed to run our GraphQL back-end.
- **Data Storage:** DynamoDB will store our application data.
- **Image Storage:** Amazon S3 bucket will be utilized to store images.
- **Authentication:** AWS Cognito will provide authentication for our application.

We will streamline the process using the AWS Amplify CLI to create and manage AWS resources, eliminating the need for manual service creation and integration.

## Step 1: Configure Amplify CLI on our local machine
## Step 2: Adding a GraphQL API
## Step 3: Query the GraphQL API from the Front-end React JS
## Step 4: Adding authentication using AWS Cognito
## Step 5: Image Storage with Amazon S3
## Step 6: Deploy Front-end React js on AWS Amplify

Happy coding!
